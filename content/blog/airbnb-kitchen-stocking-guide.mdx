## The 2x Rule for a Well-Stocked Kitchen

A reliable rule is to keep twice your maximum guest count for dishes and utensils.  
If your property accommodates eight guests, plan for about sixteen of each item, including plates, bowls, mugs, and flatware.  
This keeps guests supplied with clean items during longer stays and makes turnovers straightforward.

### Why the 2x Rule Works

**Dishwasher cadence**  
Most groups run the dishwasher once per day. Extra sets prevent running out before the next cycle.

**Real world use**  
Mugs and cups are used more often than plates, especially with larger groups or coffee drinkers.

**Turnover efficiency**  
Housekeepers can verify counts quickly and replace missing items with minimal time.
