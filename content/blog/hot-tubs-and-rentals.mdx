# Do Hot Tubs Really Increase Cabin Rentals in the Smoky Mountains?

Hot tubs are one of the most talked-about amenities in the Smoky Mountain short–term rental market, and for good reason. With millions of guests visiting Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg every year, travelers consistently prioritize properties with strong relaxation and entertainment features.

But the real question for owners and investors is simple:

**Does adding a hot tub actually increase bookings and revenue?**

At Latimere Hosting, we manage cabins of all sizes across the Smokies, and we’ve looked at this using real booking data, guest behavior, and platform patterns. This article breaks down what we’ve learned and what it means for your cabin.

## Do Hot Tubs Increase Occupancy?

In short: **yes, very often.**

Across Airbnb and VRBO searches in the Smoky Mountains, a hot tub is one of the most frequently used filters. When guests plan a mountain trip, many of them literally start their search by checking the “hot tub” box.

From typical patterns in this market, cabins with hot tubs tend to see:

- **More search visibility** because of amenity filters  
- **Higher conversion rates** from views to bookings  
- **Higher occupancy**, especially in shoulder seasons and weekends  

Guests visiting this region are looking for a “mountain experience,” and a hot tub has become part of that expectation.

Most guests filter for some combination of:

- Hot tub  
- Mountain view  
- Pet-friendly  
- Pool access  
- Game room or recreation space  

If your cabin does not appear when guests filter for hot tubs, you are instantly competing for a smaller slice of demand.

## Do Hot Tubs Increase Revenue?

Occupancy is one side of the story. The other is **average nightly rate**.

In practice, adding a hot tub usually allows owners to:

- Increase nightly rates by a noticeable margin compared to similar units without hot tubs  
- Capture more bookings during slower months when guests are price–sensitive but still willing to pay for better amenities  
- Compete for higher–value stays such as anniversaries, honeymoons, and holiday trips  

A well–maintained hot tub is one of the few amenities that:

1. Increases visibility  
2. Improves booking probability  
3. Justifies a higher nightly rate  
4. Enhances guest experience and reviews  

That combination is why hot tubs often deliver a strong return on investment in the Smoky Mountain market.

## Why Hot Tubs Matter More Here Than in Many Other Markets

The Smoky Mountains attract a specific type of trip:

- Romantic cabin getaways  
- Family cabin vacations  
- Anniversary and honeymoon stays  
- Nature–focused retreats  
- Holiday and winter trips  

In all of those scenarios, guests picture themselves in a cozy cabin, often with a view, and very often with a hot tub. In beach or city markets, hot tubs can be a nice extra. In the Smokies, they are closer to a **baseline expectation** for many travelers.

When a guest filters for cabins with a hot tub and your property does not have one, your listing is removed from their search results before they ever see it.

Put simply: in Sevierville, Pigeon Forge, and Gatlinburg, **a hot tub is not just a bonus amenity—it is a competitive feature.**

---

## Does Cabin Size Change the Impact?

Yes, cabin size makes a difference.

### Smaller cabins (1–2 bedrooms)

For 1–2 bedroom cabins marketed as romantic getaways, a hot tub is almost essential. Couples searching for a cozy cabin stay in the mountains frequently assume that a hot tub is included. Without one, you are competing with fewer tools in your toolbox.

### Larger cabins (8+ guests)

For mid–sized and large cabins, a hot tub helps you:

- Stand out in crowded search results  
- Market the property as a complete group or family experience  
- Justify higher nightly rates for larger groups  

Bigger groups are often celebrating something: a reunion, a birthday, a friends’ trip. They are more willing to pay for amenities that make the stay feel special, and a hot tub is one of those amenities.

---

## How Hot Tubs Affect Guest Reviews

Another often–missed benefit: **hot tubs show up in positive reviews**.

Guests regularly mention things like:

- Relaxing in the hot tub after a day at Dollywood or hiking  
- Enjoying the view from the deck at night  
- Spending time with family or friends in the hot tub  
- Feeling that the cabin delivered a true “mountain getaway” experience  

Better reviews lead to higher placement in search results, which leads to more bookings and more revenue. A hot tub can play a direct role in that review cycle.

## Maintenance, Costs, and Common Concerns

Hot tubs are not “set and forget.” They come with certain responsibilities:

- Regular chemical balancing  
- Filter cleaning and replacement  
- Periodic draining and refilling  
- Inspecting for leaks, pump issues, or heater problems  

For most cabins, the ongoing maintenance cost is modest compared to the revenue impact, especially when managed by a consistent vendor. The key is having a reliable process so that every guest arrives to a clean, safe, and ready–to–use hot tub.

At Latimere Hosting, we coordinate hot tub vendors, schedule service, and add clear guest instructions so that:

- The hot tub is ready at check–in  
- Water quality meets standards  
- Usage guidelines are easy to follow  
- Owners have predictable operating costs  

---

## Should Every Cabin Have a Hot Tub?

In the Smoky Mountains, the answer is: **almost always, yes.**

The few exceptions might be:

- Very small or budget–oriented cabins where the amenity does not fit the business model  
- Properties where the deck or structure cannot safely support a hot tub  
- Situations where the owner intentionally wants an ultra–low–maintenance property and accepts the trade–off in bookings and rate  

For nearly all other cabins, the combination of higher visibility, increased occupancy, stronger reviews, and the ability to charge more per night makes a compelling case.
